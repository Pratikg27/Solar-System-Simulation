🌌 Solar System Simulation:

A visually interactive Solar System Simulation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project creates an engaging experience for exploring the solar system, featuring orbiting planets, moons, dynamic effects, and interactive controls. Developed as part of a 15-day self-study module to master frontend fundamentals.


🚀 Project Overview:

This simulation brings the solar system to life on the web! Users can watch planets orbit the Sun at realistic relative speeds, observe moons revolving around Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, and interact with celestial bodies for detailed information. Background shooting stars add a cosmic flair, while controls allow pausing animations, adjusting speeds, and zooming in/out.

The project includes a main simulation page (index.html) and a dedicated details page (planet.html) for in-depth planet information, dynamically loaded based on user selection.


✨ Key Features:

	Realistic Solar System Layout: Planets are distinctly sized, colored, and positioned with varying orbital speeds and distances from the Sun.
	Dynamic Sun Simulation: A glowing, spinning Sun at the center with realistic lighting effects.
	Moon Orbits: Interactive moons orbiting Earth (1 moon), Jupiter (4 major moons), and Saturn (simplified ring/moon system).
	Shooting Star Effects: Animated background stars that streak across the screen for an immersive space atmosphere.
	Interactive Info Panel: Hover or click on any planet or moon to display details like diameter, distance from Sun, rotation period, and fun facts.
	Pause/Resume Controls: Toggle orbital and rotational animations on/off.
	Zoom Functionality: Use buttons or mouse wheel to zoom in/out for closer inspection of planets.
	Speed Control Slider: Adjust the animation speed from slow-motion to accelerated orbits.
	About Modal: A pop-up providing project info, author details, and credits.
	Smooth Scrolling & Navigation: Seamless page transitions and anchor links.
	Responsive Design: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
	Dynamic Planet Details Page: Separate page (planet.html) with expanded info, images, and facts for each planet, loaded via URL parameters.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
	Styling & Animations: CSS Keyframes, Transforms, Gradients, Box Shadows, and Media Queries
	Icons: Font Awesome (CDN)
	Interactivity: DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners, and URL Parameters for dynamic content
	No Backend/Server Required: Pure client-side; runs locally in any modern browser

⚡ Installation & How to Run:

1. Clone the Repository:
	git clone https://github.com/Pratikg27/Solar-System-Simulation.git
	cd Solar-System-Simulation

2. Open in Browser:
	Simply double-click index.html to launch the simulation in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
	No server or additional setup required—it works offline!

3. Explore:
	Interact with planets to view info.
	Click a planet to navigate to its details page (e.g., planet.html?planet=earth).
	Use controls for pause, zoom, and speed adjustments.

Note: For best performance, use a modern browser. If hosting online, ensure all files are served from the same directory.

📅 Development Timeline:

	Duration: 15 Days
	Objective: Gain hands-on experience with web animations, DOM interactions, and building interactive UIs from scratch.

📖 Learning Outcomes:

	Mastered CSS animations, keyframes, and 3D transforms for realistic orbital mechanics.
	Enhanced JavaScript skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and modular code organization.
	Learned to create responsive, accessible designs without relying on libraries.
	Practiced professional workflows: Git version control, project documentation, and clean code structure.
	Explored dynamic content loading and URL-based routing in vanilla JS.
